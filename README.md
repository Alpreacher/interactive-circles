# interactive-circles
This are interactive circles. They make some fancy jQuery type navigation for the 1st page.

1. If you want to secelt some topic you dial/turn the part of the circle to the right/left/
2. After you found the topic that you are interested at, just click your mouse on it.
3. When the program is idle for 1 minute, the dials go slowly in different directions on different circles. That is just a fancy navigation effect in order to show lots of articles in a fancy way.
